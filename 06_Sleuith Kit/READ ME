## 🧩 Step 1: Install Sleuth Kit

1. **Download Sleuth Kit**
   - Visit the official [Sleuth Kit website](https://www.sleuthkit.org/) or the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ilSFY7Tqn2L7AjQGhq8yJ8kixc_xTU-v) to download the latest version for Windows.

2. **Install Sleuth Kit**
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation on your Windows machine.

## 💾 Step 2: Acquire the Disk Image

Before analysis, you need a disk image of the evidence (e.g., hard drive, memory card).

1. **Create Disk Image**
   - Use a tool such as **FTK Imager** or **dd** to create a bit-by-bit copy of the storage device.
   - Supported formats: `.dd`, `.raw`, `.img`, `.E01`.

2. **Download Example Evidence Files**
   - From the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ilSFY7Tqn2L7AjQGhq8yJ8kixc_xTU-v), download:
     - `4Dell Latitude CPi.E01`
     - `4Dell Latitude CPi.E02`

## 💽 Step 3: Mount the Disk Image (Optional)

Mounting the disk image makes it easier to analyze the file system.

1. **Mount the Image**
   - Use a tool like **OSFMount** to mount the image as a virtual drive on your Windows system.

## 🔍 Step 4: Analyze the File System

Use Sleuth Kit tools to analyze the file system and locate evidence.

1. **Navigate to the Sleuth Kit Directory**
   - Open **Command Prompt** and go to the Sleuth Kit installation directory:
     ```bash
     cd "C:\Program Files\SleuthKit\bin"
     ```

2. **Identify File System Type with `fsstat`**
   - Run the following command to identify the file system type:
     ```bash
     fsstat [image file] > filesystem_info.txt
     ```
   - Example:
     ```bash
     fsstat C:\evidence\4Dell_Latitude_CPi.E01 > filesystem_info.txt
     ```

3. **View the File System Information**
   - Open the generated `filesystem_info.txt` file to review details about:
     - File system type
     - Volume details
     - Cluster size
     - Allocation information
